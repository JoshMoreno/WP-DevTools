# Controllers

Let's get some separation of concerns going.

This works the same way as default WP templating system. You can override parent theme controllers by including a same named controller in the child theme. You can also override a specific controller by using more specific naming (i.e `single-custom_post_type.php` will override `single.php`). This is independent of template files. Just because you have a `single-custom_post_type.php` controller does not mean you need a `single-custom_post_type.php` template file.  

### 1. Create a `controllers` folder
Create a `controllers` folder in your parent and/or child theme.

### 2. Create controllers 
In the `controllers` folder, create files following the WP template hierarchy naming conventions (i.e `single-custom_post_type.php`). This directory gets searched recursively so you can organize in folders. 

Create a class (name it whatever you'd like) that implements the `\WPDev\Controller\ControllerInterface` interface. Implement the interface by defining a `build` method that returns an array.

```php
<?php

namespace MyTheme;

use WPDev\Controller\ControllerInterface;

class SinglePost implements ControllerInterface
{
    public function build(): array
    {
        return [];
    }
}
```

### 3. Use your data and enjoy cleaner templates
Your data will be available in two ways: as `$data` (array) and as extracted variables. So `$data['some_value']` becomes `$some_value`. Use whatever you prefer.

ðŸ‘‰ There is also two more goodies that gets merged into the `$data` array - `$data['Post']` also available as `$Post`. This is an instance of `WPDev\Models\Post` and `$data['Posts']` also available as `$Posts` which is an array of posts from the main query (useful for archive pages for example).
