# More Features and Docs Coming soon!
**Still in early alpha stages.**

## Requirements
PHP 7+

## Installation
Need a better way to guarantee an early loading order so other Plugins can reliably depend on this plugin without the use of hooks such as `plugins_loaded`. Maybe on activation or something.

#### Must Use Plugin
Drop it into the `mu-plugins` folder. Run `composer install -o`.

#### Regular Plugin
This should be the first loaded plugin. This can be achieved by activating this plugin first or by using a plugin like [Plugins Load Order](https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugins-load-order/). 

## Controllers
Let's get some separation of concerns going.

This works the same way as default WP templating system. You can override parent theme controllers by including a same named controller in the child theme. You can also override a specific controller by using more specific naming (i.e `single-custom_post_type.php` will override `single.php`). This is independent of template files. Just because you have a `single-custom_post_type.php` controller does not mean you need a `single-custom_post_type.php` template file.  

1. Create a `controllers` folder in your parent and/or child theme. 

2. In the `controllers` folder, create files following the WP template hierarchy naming conventions (i.e `single-custom_post_type.php`). This directory gets searched recursively so you can organize in folders. 

3. Create a class (name it whatever you'd like) that implements the `\WPDev\Controller\ControllerInterface` interface. Implement the interface by defining a `build` method that returns an array.

```php
<?php

namespace MyTheme;

use WPDev\Controller\ControllerInterface;

class SinglePost implements ControllerInterface
{
    public function build(): array
    {
        return [];
    }
}
```

4. Your data will be available in two ways: as `$data` (array) and as extracted variables. So `$data['some_value']` becomes `$some_value`. Use whatever you prefer.

ðŸ‘‰ There is also one more goodie that gets merged into the `$data` array - `$data['Post']` also available as `$Post`. This is an instance of `WPDev\Models\Post`.
